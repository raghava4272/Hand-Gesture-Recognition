This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It identifies  gestures like “Hi,” “Thumbs Up,” “Peace,” and “Rock On” by analyzing hand landmark data. The application leverages machine learning and computer vision to provide an intuitive interface for gesture-based interaction, offering potential use cases in robotics, sign language interpretation, and more.
